Production Docker Environment
#############################

The production docker setup has been created with the following considerations:

The ``dockerfile``, ``docker-compose.yml`` and the resultant ``docker image`` should be self |end| contained with everything required to run ontomatica.com.

It should be a fully baked Image. However, it should also be a trimmed docker image without optional packages/dependencies.

Only necessary packages/libraries/binaries should be a part of the docker image. Trimmed, yet self |end| contained. 

There should be no code sharing between hosts and the containers. 

Minimal volumes “mounts” to avoid any intrusion.
