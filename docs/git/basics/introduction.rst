About Version Control
=====================
* :cite:`GitDocumentation`

Why we have Version Control?
----------------------------

Centralized vs. Decentralized
-----------------------------
#. Centralized:

    * Single truth
    * Simple revision numbers
    * Timeline is always straight
    * Single point of failure
    * Simpler branches
    * Small number of branches

#. Decentralized

    * Unable to use incremented int as revision numbers
    * Use hashes
    * All repositories are equal
    * Any repository can have different history
    * More diverged branches
    * Can have many branches


Design Philosophy
=================
#. Tracking file permissions
#. Tracking file renames and moves
#. Key-Value Storage of Immutable Objects
#. Working Offline
#. Efficient Storage
