# Local Development Environment:

The docker setup for local dev env has been designed with the following considerations:

The codebase will reside on the host, so that if developers would like to use their favorite IDEs, they can without any issues. Also, they can develop/change the code the way they have been doing so far.

The method to reflect the changes to the code has also been kept very similar to facilitate smooth transition.

At the same time, it is important to ensure that the development env remains consistent across different Operating Systems/platforms.

For the same docker comes to the rescue. The idea is to have the dependencies packaged within a docker Image and the code to be shared between the host and the container via ```bind-mount``` docker volume.

So, the container would have dependencies per-installed/baked as per the Dockerfile and the code will be accessible to it via docker volume.

Developers can do the changes as usual and to bring them to effect they need to follow the below steps. Flexibility to transition from docker to non-docker env or vice-versa is ensured.
